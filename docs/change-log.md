# Task Management System Change Log

This document captures the key functional and structural changes applied during the recent refresh of the Task Management System admin and employee dashboards. Entries are ordered chronologically (latest first).

## 2024-??-?? — Dashboard UX overhaul and task workflow

### High-level goals
- Align the employee dashboard visuals with the new admin look and feel.
- Surface task metrics sourced directly from `localStorage` so counts remain consistent across sessions.
- Allow both employees and admins to move tasks between statuses and manage subtasks inline.

### Notable changes

1. **Employee dashboard redesign**
   - `src/components/Dashboard/EmployeeDashboard.jsx`
     - Introduced a glassmorphism layout similar to the admin experience.
     - Injected summary cards (`EmployeeTaskSummary`) above the carousel and forwarded callbacks for creating tasks, subtasks, and status changes.

2. **Summary metric cards**
   - `src/components/Navigations/EmployeeTaskSummary.jsx`
     - New component that displays pending, in-progress, completed, failed, and accepted counts from the hydrated `taskCounts` object.
     - Shows the total number of tasks associated with the employee.

3. **Reusable modal shell**
   - `src/components/Common/Modal.jsx`
     - Added a shared modal component used by admin task and employee forms.
   - `src/components/Navigations/CreateTask.jsx`, `CreateEmployee.jsx`
     - Updated to support modal mode with responsive sizing, validation feedback, and success indicators.

4. **Admin dashboard parity**
   - `src/components/Dashboard/AdminDashboard.jsx`
     - Added summary ribbon, flash messages, toggles to open/close modals, and aggregated task list with status selectors.

5. **Inline subtask management**
   - `src/components/TaskList/SubTaskSection.jsx`
     - New helper that renders existing subtasks and an inline form for creating more.
   - Integrated into each task card (`NewTask`, `InProgressTask`, `CompleteTask`, `FailedTask`).

6. **Status action bar**
   - `src/components/TaskList/AcceptTask.jsx`
     - Replaced the previous placeholder buttons with a configurable action strip supporting “Move to In Progress”, “Mark as Completed/Failed”, and other transitions.

7. **Task list wiring**
   - `src/components/TaskList/TaskList.jsx`
     - Coordinates subtask additions and status changes for every card.

8. **State + persistence sync**
   - `src/App.jsx`
     - On login we hydrate the logged-in employee with recalculated counts to keep the UI in sync with `localStorage`.
     - Every task, subtask, or status mutation now recalculates counts, updates the React state, and writes back to storage.

## 2024-??-?? — Admin profile alignment and login improvements

1. **Seeded admin metadata**
   - `src/utils/localStorage.jsx`
     - Populate the admin record with id `02`, name “Avir Singh”, email `AnshuRajSingh@outlook.com`, and password `123`.
     - Overwrite stale admin entries in `localStorage` so the new credentials always apply.

2. **Credential-aware login flow**
   - `src/App.jsx`
     - Replaced the hardcoded admin email with a lookup against the seeded record, including trimming and case-insensitive matching.
     - Persist the admin payload and trigger a “Logged in as admin” alert after successful login.

3. **Header greeting update**
   - `src/components/Navigations/Header.jsx`
     - Prefer `data.name` when `firstName` is absent so the admin greeting reads “Hello Avir Singh”.

## 2024-??-?? — Task creation modal restyle

1. **Professional modal design**
   - `src/components/Navigations/CreateTask.jsx`
     - Rebuilt the modal layout with a centered hero header, highlight cards, and refreshed form styling so it feels consistent across dashboards.
     - Improved self-assignment messaging when employees create tasks directly.
   - `src/components/Dashboard/EmployeeDashboard.jsx`, `src/components/TaskList/TaskList.jsx`
     - Employee dashboard opens the same polished modal via a dedicated trigger card, hiding the inline carousel button.

## 2024-??-?? — Employee dashboard visual refresh

1. **Hero workspace layout**
   - `src/components/Dashboard/EmployeeDashboard.jsx`
     - Introduced a glass hero card with inline metrics, a gradient background, and a refreshed CTA for launching the task composer.
     - Wrapped the task board in a styled container with live-update hints so the module feels cohesive.
2. **Summary integration support**
   - `src/components/Navigations/EmployeeTaskSummary.jsx`
     - Added an optional `className` prop so the summary cards can slot into the new layout without excess spacing.

## 2024-??-?? — Signup flow and editable profiles

1. **Signup-ready authentication**
   - `src/components/Auth/Login.jsx`, `src/App.jsx`
     - Added a full registration path that captures name, email, password, occupation, DOB, location, and bio, persists the new employee to localStorage/context, and logs them in immediately.
2. **Editable profile snapshot**
   - `src/components/Navigations/EmployeeProfileCard.jsx`, `src/components/common/ToastPortal.jsx`
     - Employees can edit their profile details directly from the dashboard; changes persist via `commitEmployeeUpdate`, and a toast confirms success.
3. **Admin dashboard refresh & task list virtualization**
   - `src/components/Dashboard/AdminDashboard.jsx`, `src/components/Navigations/AdminTaskSummary.jsx`
     - Synced summary cards with `taskCounts` from local storage and restyled the admin hero to match the employee experience.
   - `src/components/Navigations/AllTask.jsx`
     - Added lazy-loading for the task list (10 at a time) and status-aware filtering when clicking summary cards.
4. **Unified header styling**
   - `src/components/Navigations/Header.jsx`
     - Replaced the utilitarian header with a gradient glass card inspired by the new design direction, including dynamic greeting details and a standout logout CTA.

### Data considerations
- `src/utils/localStorage.jsx`
  - Seed data remains untouched, but counts may diverge from truth if tasks were edited outside the app before this update. The new recalculation logic corrects the numbers as soon as tasks mutate or the user logs in.

### Follow-up ideas
- Display toast notifications after status changes or subtask additions.
- Add per-subtask completion toggles and progress indicators on each card.
- Expand the changelog with future updates to keep design/product stakeholders aligned.
