## Overview
The Task Management System (TMS) is a front-end focused workspace that allows administrators and employees to collaborate on task planning, tracking, and completion. The experience is built with React and relies on browser `localStorage` as its data layer, enabling quick prototyping without a dedicated backend.

## Core Personas
- **Administrator**: Onboards employees, creates tasks on their behalf, tracks portfolio-wide progress, and can update task states.
- **Employee**: Logs in to manage personal tasks, create new assignments, add subtasks, and keep their profile up to date.
